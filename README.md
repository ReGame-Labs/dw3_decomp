A work in progress matching decompilation of **Digimon World 3** for the
PlayStation: C source that compiles back into byte-identical copies of the
game's executable, its overlays and its stages. The European release,
*Digimon World 2003* (`SLES_039.36`), the most complete one, is the main
version: the build's default and the one decomp.dev shows first. The USA
release, *Digimon World 3* (`SLUS_014.36`), builds from the same C and
matches byte for byte too.

This repository does not contain any game data. You need your own copy of the
game to build it.

## Status

Measured with `make report` on both versions; the badges above are always
current:

| Part | Version | Functions in C | Code | Data |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Executable, game code | Europe | 346 / 346 | 100.00 % | 100.00 % |
| | USA | 346 / 346 | 100.00 % | 100.00 % |
| The 21 overlays | Europe | 1,670 / 1,670 | 100.00 % | 100.00 % |
| | USA | 1,665 / 1,665 | 100.00 % | 100.00 % |
| The stages (293 and 238) | Europe | 1,590 / 1,590 | 100.00 % | 100.00 % |
| | USA | 1,369 / 1,369 | 100.00 % | 100.00 % |
| **Total** | **Europe** | **3,606 / 3,606** | **100.00 %** | **100.00 %** |
| | **USA** | **3,380 / 3,380** | **100.00 %** | **100.00 %** |

- The game's code and data are all C in both versions: the executable,
  the 21 overlays and all the stages.
- The PsyQ libraries are Sony's code, not the game's: the build takes them
  from the original as splat's disassembly and the progress leaves them out.
- [docs/status.md](docs/status.md) has the details of each part, how the
  progress is measured, and the fake matches and hacks the badge counts.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

On Debian or Ubuntu (the CI uses Ubuntu 24.04 and Python 3.12), install:
```
binutils-mipsel-linux-gnu gcc-mipsel-linux-gnu git make python3 python3-venv unzip wget
```
Or build in Docker instead ([below](#building-with-docker)).

Clone with the submodules (maspsx, m2c, decomp-permuter and the PsyQ
headers), create the Python environment, which must be active whenever you
run `make` or the scripts in `tools/`, and download the prebuilt tools (GCC
2.8.1 for the PSX, objdiff-cli and mkpsxiso) into `bin/`, checked against
`tools/deps.sha256`:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ReGame-Labs/dw3_decomp.git
cd dw3_decomp            # in an existing clone: git submodule update --init --recursive
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
tools/dl_deps.sh
```

### Getting the game files

Each disc goes in its own `disks/<version>/`. Extract it with
`tools/extract_disc.py`, which also reaches the `AAA/` directories, and check
the executable:
```
python3 tools/extract_disc.py "/path/to/Digimon World 3 (USA).bin" disks/us
sha1sum disks/us/SLUS_014.36   # 444653259f78ddb483fd22af72cce9276f42f214

python3 tools/extract_disc.py "/path/to/Digimon World 2003 (Europe).bin" disks/eu
sha1sum disks/eu/SLES_039.36   # d1b7e4d646e3a9c2b88fdb25d20b5f7116bbb06d
```

Only `disks/<version>/<executable>` and `disks/<version>/AAA/PRO/` are
needed, and only for the versions you build. `config/<version>/` holds the
SHA-1 of every original binary, which `make compare` checks the build
against: `<executable>.sha1`, `overlays.sha1` and `stages.sha1`.

### Build

The same steps build each version, with `VERSION` set to `eu` or `us` (`eu`
when it is left out):
```
# Split the executable, the overlays and the stages with splat
# (asm/<version>/, build/<version>/generated/)
make VERSION=eu generate

# Build build/<version>/<executable> and build/<version>/AAA/PRO/*.PRO
make VERSION=eu -j$(nproc)

# Check the executable, every overlay and every stage against the originals
make VERSION=eu compare
```

`make compare` prints one `OK` per binary, and a change only counts once
every line still says `OK`: 261 lines for `us` (the executable, 21 overlays
and 239 stages, `WSTAG260` among them), 316 for `eu` (the executable, 21
overlays and 294 stages):
```
build/eu/SLES_039.36: OK
build/eu/AAA/PRO/CNTY_SEL.PRO: OK
...
```
The CI builds and compares both versions on every push.

`make VERSION=<version> regenerate` deletes `asm/<version>/`,
`build/<version>/`, `expected/<version>/` and `assets/<version>/`, and splits
the binaries again. Run it after changing a `config/<version>/*.yaml`, a symbol file or
`stages.txt`, so that no stale files stay behind in `asm/<version>/`.

### Building with Docker

`tools/docker.sh` builds the CI's build environment from the `Dockerfile`
(Ubuntu 24.04, the MIPS binutils, Python and the prebuilt tools, no game
data) and runs a command in it, as your own user; without a command it opens
a shell. No `bin/` or `.venv` is needed on the host. With the submodules and
the disc files in `disks/` as above:
```
tools/docker.sh make generate
tools/docker.sh sh -c 'make -j$(nproc)'
tools/docker.sh make compare
VERSION=us tools/docker.sh make generate
```
[docs/toolchain.md](docs/toolchain.md#docker) has the details.

### Checks

The CI runs these on every push; run them before opening a pull request:
```
make VERSION=eu report        # build/<version>/report.json, the progress
make VERSION=eu shiftcheck    # every address in the code and data is a symbol
make VERSION=eu padcheck      # linked higher, words change only at relocations
make VERSION=eu lint          # a modern GCC checks the declarations
python3 tools/hacks.py --check README.md docs/status.md   # the hacks badge and table
python3 tools/check_names.py  # every version uses the USA version's names
```
[docs/shifting.md](docs/shifting.md) explains `shiftcheck` and `padcheck`,
[docs/toolchain.md](docs/toolchain.md#declaration-check) `lint`, and
[docs/status.md](docs/status.md#progress) the report.

  progress is measured, and the fake matches and hacks.

  tools.

  that keep it (`shiftcheck`, `padcheck`, `inputcheck`).

  matching, versions, code style, names and pull requests.
- [TODO.md](TODO.md): what is left to do.

## Contributing

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a pull request. In
short: every function starts as an `INCLUDE_ASM` line in `src/`. To
decompile one, get a first draft from m2c, make it match with
`tools/try_match.py`, objdiff and, for a near miss, the permuter, then replace
the `INCLUDE_ASM` with it and check that `make compare` still says `OK` for
every binary of both versions.

The PsyQ functions were named from the
[PsyQ 4.7 signatures](https://github.com/lab313ru/psx_psyq_signatures).
