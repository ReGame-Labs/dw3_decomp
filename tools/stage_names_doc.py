"""
Writes, at the top of each stage's C file, a comment that says which map or
event the stage is, and the same names in src/stages/README.md.

    tools/stage_names_doc.py [-n]

The comment is the block that starts the file, before its first #include:

    /*
     * WSTAG210: Main Lobby, Asuka City.
     */

The script replaces only that block (or adds it) and rewrites the README
through tools/stage_areas.py, so it can be run again at any time, after a
rebase too. -n lists the files it would change, and fails if there are any.

The names come from the game (see STAGES): the banner FIELDSTG shows as the
player enters, "area / place" (FIELDSTG_stages gives a stage its modes,
FIELDSTG_areaNames a mode its strings of text files 0xAA and 0xB8, STAREA and
STNAME), STAGSLCT's list of the scenes, and where the banner is the same for
several stages, their exits, warps and place points (StageSlot and
StagePoint modes), their talk and event texts, and the story point
(GAME.progress) that picks them.
