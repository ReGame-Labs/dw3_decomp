"""
Moves each stage's C file into the folder of its area: src/field/stages/<area>/.

FIELDSTG starts a stage for a mode (FIELDSTG_stages, and the European
FIELDSTG_euStages: {mode, file, WSTAGnnn_startStage}), and shows the name of
the mode's area as the player enters (FIELDSTG_areaNames: {area, place,
mode}; the area is a string of text file 0xAA, STAREA). Every mode of a
stage is in one area, whose name in lower_snake_case is its folder:
src/field/stages/wstag231.c goes to src/field/stages/amaterasu_city/wstag231.c, with
its head if it has one (wstag924_head.c). WSTAG260, the story events'
scripts, which FIELDSTG starts with FIELDSTG_createStoryEvents, stays in
src/field/stages/, and so does common/.

It also writes src/field/stages/README.md, the list of the areas and their
stages, with each stage's name from tools/stage_names_doc.py. The build finds a stage wherever it is under src/field/stages/, so the
bytes don't change. It can be run again at any time:

    tools/stage_areas.py [-n]

-n lists what it would move without moving it.

Each stage overlay, AAA/PRO/WSTAG###.PRO, is one C file, `wstag###.c`, in
the folder of the area that FIELDSTG names when the player enters it
(FIELDSTG_stages gives a stage its modes, FIELDSTG_areaNames a mode its
area, a string of text file 0xAA). `tools/stage_areas.py` moves them and
writes this list.

- `common/` holds the code that several stages share, which they include.
- `wstag260.c`, the story events' scripts, is the file mode 528 (Asuka
  City's Cargo Tower) loads, but FIELDSTG starts that mode with its own
  FIELDSTG_createStoryEvents, so the stage has no code and stays here.

The cities have two copies of their stages, one for each server (Asuka and
Amaterasu, Seiryu and Qing Long, Suzaku and Zhu Que, Byakko and Bai Hu),
and the European version adds stages of its own (920 and up) to the areas.

Each stage's file starts with a comment that says which map or event it is
(`tools/stage_names_doc.py` writes them, and the names below).
